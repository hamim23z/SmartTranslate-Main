SmartTranslate is a website used to translate YouTube videos and text to any language! Simply enter your YouTube video link and then the video will be translated to whatever language you chose. For text, it's just like Google Translate, enter a word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph and it'll be translated. 

- Languages Used: Javascript and HTML
- Libraries Used: React, MUI, Axios, Google Translate API, and maybe OpenAI Whisper
- Frameworks Used: Next.js and Node.js

Yes, there will be other libraries used. They can be found in the package.json file. These can be some YouTube libraries or anything else that I may add in the future.
